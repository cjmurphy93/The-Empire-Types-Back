  "description": "Recently I became the proud new owner of a brand new mechanical keyboard. It is obviously much diferent from my last one, and I wanted a way to quickly adapt to it. So I figured, why not make a game out of it, and integrate it with my favorite franchise! The Empire Types back is an interactive game where the user pilots a starfighter and has to type to destroy enimy ships racing towards them. Upon completing the word on top of the enemy, that ship will be eliminated.",
